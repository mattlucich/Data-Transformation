## Overview

The first objective in this process is loading the data, followed by cleaning up the data so that it takes on an expected dataframe form (i.e. empty rows, or null values when not appropriate). Next, we transform the data, moving from wide to long in order to more easily analyze. Conversely, we widen the column denoting delayed and on time flights, again, to more easily analyze. Lastly, airlines are compared at aggregate and at a city level, resulting in interesting findings (discussed in the conclusion).

### Loading the data

```{r}

# Load arrival delays csv from Github URL
#arrivaldelays <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattlucich/tidy-data/tidy/arrival-delays.csv"))

# Load arrival delays csv from Github repo (if you prefer)
df_arrival_delays <- read.csv("arrival-delays.csv")

# View the data
df_arrival_delays

```

### Cleaning the data

```{r}
# Filter out empty rows
df_ad_wide <- df_arrival_delays %>% filter(X.1 != "")

# If X (airline) is empty fill in value from previous row
df_ad_wide <- df_ad_wide %>% mutate(airline = ifelse(X=="", lag(X), X))

# Drop unneeded row
df_ad_wide <- df_ad_wide[-c(1)]

# Rename columns
df_ad_wide <- df_ad_wide %>% 
            rename(
              status = X.1,
              los_angeles = "Los.Angeles",
              phoenix = "Phoenix",
              san_diego = "San.Diego",
              san_franchisco = "San.Francisco",
              seattle = "Seattle"
              )

# Remove commas to convert to numeric
df_ad_wide <- as.data.frame(lapply(df_ad_wide, function(y) gsub(",", "", y)))

# Reorder columns
df_ad_wide <- df_ad_wide[, c(7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)]
df_ad_wide

```


## Transforming the data

```{r}

# Gather city columns into one column "city" and their values to "delay"
df_ad_long <- df_ad_wide %>% 
                        pivot_longer(
                          cols = los_angeles:seattle, 
                          names_to = "city", 
                          values_to = "delay",
                          values_drop_na = TRUE
                        )
df_ad_long

```



### Analyzing the airline and city combinations (and more transformations)

```{r}

# Concat airline and city into one column
df_ad_long$airline_city <- paste(df_ad_long$airline,df_ad_long$city)

# Widen data in order to see on-time percentage by airline by location
df_airline_city_wide <- df_ad_long %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = status, values_from = delay)

# Add on-time percentage column
df_airline_city_wide <- df_airline_city_wide %>%
    mutate(ontime_perc = as.numeric(`on time`) / (as.numeric(`on time`) + as.numeric(delayed)))
df_airline_city_wide

# Histogram: ontime percentage
ggplot(df_airline_city_wide, aes(x=airline_city, weights=ontime_perc)) + 
  geom_bar(fill="turquoise3") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  ggtitle("Airline City Ontime %") + ylab("Ontime %")

# Groupby airline_city and status
df_airline_city_long <- df_ad_long %>%
  group_by(airline_city, status) %>%
  summarize(count = as.numeric(delay))

# Stacked histogram: ontime and delay counts
ggplot(df_airline_city_long, aes(x=airline_city, weights=count, fill=status)) + 
  geom_bar() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  ggtitle("Airline City Ontime vs Delay")

```


### Analyzing airlines (and more transformations)

```{r}

# Arrival delays by airline
df_airline_wide <- df_airline_city_wide %>%
    group_by(airline) %>%
    summarize(delay_total = sum(as.numeric(delayed)),
              ontime_total = sum(as.numeric(`on time`)))

# Add on-time percentage column
df_airline_wide <- df_airline_wide %>%
    mutate(ontime_perc = as.numeric(ontime_total) / (as.numeric(ontime_total) + as.numeric(delay_total)))
df_airline_wide

# Histogram: ontime percentage
ggplot(df_airline_wide, aes(x=airline, weights=ontime_perc)) + 
  geom_bar(fill="turquoise3") + ggtitle("Airline City Ontime %") + ylab("Ontime %")

# Groupby airline and status
df_airline_long <- df_ad_long %>%
  group_by(airline, status) %>%
  summarize(count = sum(as.numeric(delay)))
df_airline_long

# Stacked histogram: ontime and delay counts
ggplot(df_airline_long, aes(x=airline, weights=count, fill=status)) + 
  geom_bar() + ggtitle("Airline Ontime vs Delay")

```


## Conclusion

The comparison of Alaska and AM West airlines is an ideal example of Simpson's Paradox. We can see from the table grouped by airlines and locations that Alaska beats AM West in every location comparison of on time percentage (e.g. Alaska's Los Angeles on time % vs AM West's Los Angeles on time %). However, we see that AM West has a higher overall on time percentage. This is mainly attributable to AM West having a high volume of flights to Phoenix with a relatively high on time percent as well as Alaska having a high volume of flights to Seattle with a relatively low on time percent.
